Once upon a time there was on old grandma with dementia who had a super pet iguana. 
The grandma ended up on her death bed, the iguana sitting beside her.
The iguana used his super powers to resurrect the grandma. Unfortunately the grandma was ressurected as something else...
the grandma turned into... A SNAKE!! When she awakened from her slight slumber
All of a sudden, the grandma snake sprouted legs, arms, and grabbed the hidden sword out of her cane!
and tried to ATTACK the iguana, her dementia still in place even after her resurrection.
Right before the sword reached the iguana's heart, Humpty Dumpty from Shrek leaped in front of the violent attack!
he immediately took a big hit, the iguana in shock and mournful for the fallen stranger that risked his life for him..
Little did snake gramms know, it was a full moon, the iguana was transformed into an alpha wolf and charged at gramms!
